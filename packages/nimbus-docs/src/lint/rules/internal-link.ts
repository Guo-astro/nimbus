/**
 * nimbus/internal-link — internal links whose destination is confirmed
 * missing. Reads route truth from `.nimbus/routes.json`, which `astro build`
 * writes from Astro's pages, every emitted file, and the site's redirects.
 *
 * Missing route truth fails closed in `nimbus-docs lint`: when the file is
 * missing, unreadable, incomplete, or has an unknown `version`, the CLI
 * reports one `error` on `.nimbus/routes.json` and doesn't run this rule
 * (`guardRouteTruth` in `engine.ts`). `nimbus-docs check` runs the rule
 * when the file exists, and turns a missing file into a note. If the rule
 * is still reached without usable truth, it writes one line to stderr and
 * reports nothing.
 *
 * Coverage: every link `link-occurrences.ts` collects — Markdown links,
 * reference links, MDX `<a href>`, and the components named in the
 * `components: [{ name, attr }, …]` option (e.g. the starter's
 * `<LinkCard href>`; the framework only ships the `<a>` default because
 * component names belong to the user).
 *
 * Resolution (`link-resolver.ts`, shared with `nimbus/redirected-link`):
 *   - External links (with a scheme) are skipped.
 *   - In-page anchors (`#section`) are skipped (hash validation lives in
 *     the future `nimbus/internal-link-hash` rule).
 *   - Links and routes share one key (`_internal/route-key.ts`): no query,
 *     hash, or trailing slash, percent-decoded, `foo/index.html` and
 *     `foo.html` as `/foo`.
 *   - Astro's `base` is never stripped. The renderer prefixes `base` to
 *     every authored root-relative link, so authored `/x` is compared with
 *     the base-free route `/x`, and a link that repeats the base
 *     (`/docs/x` under `base: "/docs"`) is reported: it renders as
 *     `/docs/docs/x`.
 *   - A link that matches a redirect follows the chain, and is broken only
 *     when the chain ends nowhere, loops, or runs past 20 hops.
 *   - Links under an opaque namespace (a non-framework dynamic route file)
 *     stay silent — silence beats false-positive.
 *   - A near-match in the route set produces a "did you mean" hint via
 *     Levenshtein distance — same pattern `component-pascalcase` uses. The
 *     hint prints the route as stored, which is how the link should be
 *     written.
 *   - `ignore: string[]` supports full glob syntax (`**`, `*`, `{a,b}`, …)
 *     via `../../_internal/ignore-glob.js` (picomatch-backed), matched
 *     against the link's route key: the authored path without trailing
 *     slash, hash, or query. Patterns are written without `base`, like
 *     links. Use it for paths another system serves on the same domain,
 *     which the build can't see.
 *
 * Relative links (`./foo`, `../bar`, bare `foo`) error by default. `allowRelative: true`
 * silences them for projects that want to use them.
